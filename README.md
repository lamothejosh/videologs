# Video Logs

Video Logs is a web application for recording video or audio diaries and organizing them for later review. The goal is to build a simple PWA (Progressive Web App) that runs on desktop or mobile.

## Core Features
- Record video or audio in the browser
- Automatically transcribe entries using Whisper
- Add tags or notes to each entry
- Search entries by text, tag, or date
- Replay previous logs

The project uses React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and FastAPI with Whisper for the backend.

## Directory Structure
- `frontend/` – React application
- `backend/` – FastAPI services and transcription logic

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd videologs
   ```
2. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. Make changes and commit:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

More documentation will be added as the project evolves.
